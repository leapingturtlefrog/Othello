**Othello Game**

This is a small Othello game I made a bit ago for play in the console. Download the highest version executable (ending in a version formatted as x.xxx.exe) for windows or "main.py" for other operating systems and use the `py main.py` command to run in the directory "main.py" is downloaded to.
