**Othello Trainer Game**

This is a small Othello game I made a bit ago for play in the console when learning python.
<br><br>
I have plans in the future to make it much better (maybe in Java) and use better code practices.
<br><br>
For now, you can download the highest versioned executable for windows or "main.py" for other operating systems and use the `py main.py` command to run in the directory "main.py" is downloaded to with python properly installed.
